    "#**Description:**\n",
    "\n",
    "This project conducts an in-depth analysis of funding trends within the Indian startup ecosystem from 2018 to 2021, employing the CRISP-DM methodology. Leveraging comprehensive datasets on funding details, our goal is to identify patterns, fluctuations, and key insights into the funding landscape of Indian startups during this period. By examining funding amounts, types, sectors, and geographical distributions, we aim to provide actionable recommendations for stakeholders navigating the dynamic funding environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "#**Hypothesis**\n",
    "\n",
    "#**Null Hypothesis (H₀)**\n",
    "\n",
    "The funding landscape of Indian startups from 2018 to 2021 is not significantly influenced by economic conditions, industry sector performance, and investor sentiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "#**Alternative Hypothesis (H₁)**\n",
    "\n",
    "The funding landscape of Indian startups from 2018 to 2021 is significantly influenced by economic conditions, industry sector performance, and investor sentiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Business Questions**\n",
    "1. What are the overall trends in funding amounts received by startups in India from 2018 to 2021, and how do they vary across different years and sectors?\n",
    "2. Which funding stages (e.g., seed, Series A, Series B) have been most prevalent among Indian startups during this period, and have there been any notable shifts in stage preferences over time?\n",
    "3. Are there specific industry sectors that have consistently attracted higher levels of funding, and what are the driving factors behind their attractiveness to investors?\n",
    "4. How does the geographical distribution of funding vary across different regions of India, and are there any emerging startup hubs or regions experiencing significant growth in funding activity?\n",
    "5. What role do external factors such as global economic trends, government policies, and technological advancements play in shaping funding trends within the Indian startup ecosystem during this timeframe?"
