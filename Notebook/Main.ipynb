    "**Description:**\n",
    "\n",
    "This project conducts an in-depth analysis of funding trends within the Indian startup ecosystem from 2018 to 2021, employing the CRISP-DM methodology. Leveraging comprehensive datasets on funding details, our goal is to identify patterns, fluctuations, and key insights into the funding landscape of Indian startups during this period. By examining funding amounts, types, sectors, and geographical distributions, we aim to provide actionable recommendations for stakeholders navigating the dynamic funding environment.\n",

    "How did the prevalence of different funding stages shift over time, and what does this indicate about the maturity and development of the Indian startup ecosystem?\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Geographical Distribution of Funding:**\n",
    "\n",
    "How was funding distributed across various regions in India, and which regions emerged as major startup hubs from 2018 to 2021?\n",
