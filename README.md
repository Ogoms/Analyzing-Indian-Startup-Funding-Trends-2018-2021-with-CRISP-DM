Title: Analyzing Indian Startup Funding Trends with CRISP-DM

Introduction

In 2021, Indian startups raised a record-breaking $42 billion across 1,583 deals, a significant increase from the $11.5 billion in 2020. This growth illustrates the rapid expansion and increasing investor confidence in the Indian startup ecosystem, further evidenced by the emergence of 44 new unicorns in a single year. I used the CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) methodology to explore these funding trends. This structured approach involved understanding business objectives, preparing data, and applying analytical techniques to derive insights. Following CRISP-DM, I ensured a comprehensive and systematic analysis of the Indian startup funding landscape and identified emerging industry trends and investment hotspots.

CRISP-DM Overview

CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) is a widely adopted methodology providing a structured approach to data mining projects, ensuring systematic and effective derivation of data-driven insights.

Phases:
1. Business Understanding: Comprehend project objectives and requirements from a business perspective, converting this into a data mining problem definition and a preliminary plan.
2. Data Understanding: Collect data and perform activities to familiarize with it, identify quality issues, discover initial insights, and detect interesting subsets for hypothesis formulation.
3. Data Preparation: Construct the final dataset from raw data, including selecting tables, records, and attributes, as well as cleaning and transforming the data.
4. Modeling: Select and apply various modeling techniques, calibrating parameters to optimal values. This phase may require returning to data preparation for format adjustments.
5. Evaluation: Thoroughly evaluate the model(s) to ensure they meet business objectives, addressing any overlooked business issues.
6. Deployment: Deploy the data mining results into day-to-day business operations, ranging from generating reports to implementing repeatable data mining processes.

Phase 1: Business Understanding
Objective: Understand funding trends in the Indian startup ecosystem.
Key Questions:
1. How did total funding amounts for startups change each year, and were there significant peaks or troughs during this period?
2. Which sectors received the most funding, and how did this distribution change over the years? What makes certain sectors more attractive to investors?
3. What were the most common funding stages for Indian startups during this period?
4. How was funding distributed across various regions in India, and which regions emerged as major startup hubs? What contributed to the rise of these hubs?
5. How did global economic trends, such as revenue growth, affect funding trends in the Indian startup ecosystem?
6. How did investor preferences evolve concerning sectors, funding stages, and geographic locations?

Phase 2: Data Understanding
Data Sources: Some of the data were sourced from a SQL database while some were imported CSV files. Here's a brief pictorial overview of the concatenated dataset. 

Data Description: The dataset consists of 2879 entries with 10 columns. Key data attributes include company brand, founding year, headquarters location, sector, company description, founders' names, investors involved, funding amount, funding stage, and an additional column labelled "column10". The dataset exhibits a mix of data types, including object types for categorical variables and a float type for the founding year.

Initial Exploration: Initial observations suggest significant missing data in several columns, notably in the "Stage" and "column10" columns, with 938 and 2877 missing values respectively. The "Amount" column exhibits inconsistencies with various currencies, indicating the need for standardization. Additionally, there's a wide range of unique values in columns like "What_it_does" and "Founders," suggesting diversity in company descriptions and founders' names.

Phase 3: Data Preparation
Cleaning: In these data-cleaning steps, the dataset was standardized by converting specific columns to their appropriate data types, such as converting 'Founded' to numeric and ensuring certain text columns are in the title case. Missing values are then handled by filling them with either the median or mode for numerical and categorical columns, respectively. Lastly, duplicates are removed, inconsistencies in company brand names are resolved by converting them to lowercase, an unnecessary column "column 10" was dropped, and the 'Founded' column was ensured to be an integer.

Transformation: Since the 'Amount' and 'Founded' columns are numeric, we can use them to create proxies for deriving insights and potential metrics on success and revenue growth.

Summary Statistics: The dataset contains 2,853 entries covering various companies, with detailed statistics such as company brand, founding year, headquarters, sector, and financial details. Among notable data points, 'Bharatpe' is the most frequent brand, and Bangalore is the most common headquarters. Financial figures show a wide range, with investment amounts ranging from $7,500 to $70 billion, and significant variability is observed in the success scores.

Hypothesis
